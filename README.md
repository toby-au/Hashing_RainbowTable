# Hashing_RainbowTable

The file rainbowTable consists of a class and a variety of functions that create the table and compares tables and hash-values. 

The file "cracker" has default passwords and result's lists. 

The program then creates two hash tables or "rainbow" tables consisting of a filename, a dictionary as the table, the number of similar passwords found ,and the number of similar hash values found. 

Then it goes through a series of 12 tests comparing the two hash tables to see if the generated hash values reveal similar passwords. 

This assignment should reveal that each test should return True.
